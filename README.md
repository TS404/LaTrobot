# LaTrobot
A set of scripts in R to disambiguate and add open data from La Trobe University to Wikidata

Inspired by the conceptual framework of [Steve Baskauf's](https://github.com/baskaufs) [VanderBot](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/linked-data/tree/master/vanderbot) but implemented in R rather than Python.
